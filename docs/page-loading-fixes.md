# Page Loading Issues Fix

This document explains the issues that were causing the About Us and Careers pages to fail to load and the fixes that were implemented.

## Issues Identified

1. **External Image Dependencies**: Both pages were using external images from `https://www.acquisition-international.com/` which could fail to load due to:
   - Network connectivity issues
   - CORS restrictions
   - Server downtime
   - Image URL changes

2. **Image Optimization Configuration**: The `next.config.ts` file was not configured to allow images from the external domain.

3. **No Error Handling**: The pages had no fallback mechanism if images failed to load.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Replaced External Images with Local Images

- Changed image sources from external URLs to local images in the `public/images` directory
- Used `hero1.png` and `hero2.png` which are already part of the project
- This eliminates dependency on external servers

### 2. Updated Next.js Configuration

- Added the external domain to `remotePatterns` in `next.config.ts` to allow image optimization
- This ensures that if external images are used in the future, they will be properly optimized

### 3. Added Error Boundaries and Fallbacks

- Implemented error handling for images using the `onError` prop
- Added fallback UI (gradient background) when images fail to load
- Used the `useState` hook to track image loading status

### 4. Added Client-Side Rendering

- Added `'use client'` directive to both pages to ensure proper client-side rendering
- This helps with image loading and error handling

## Testing

You can test the fixes by visiting:
- `/test-pages` - A test page with links to both pages
- `/about` - The About Us page
- `/careers` - The Careers page

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Prefer local images over external ones when possible
2. Always implement error boundaries for critical UI components
3. Test pages with poor network conditions
4. Use the `onError` prop for images to provide fallbacks
